        <h1>This is a mother****ing website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's ****ing perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the **** else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your **** is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some ****ing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, mother****er. Let me describe your perfect-*** website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your ****ty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your ****ty browsers</li>
            <li>The mother****er's accessible to every ***hole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your ****ing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, mother****er:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this ****. It's a mother****ing website. Why the **** do you need to animate a ****ing trendy-*** banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of ****? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your ****ing site, and some mother****er jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that ****. Not to mention blind people will never see that ****, but they don't see any of your ****ty ****.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's ****ing lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your ****ing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the ****ing background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a ****ty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of ****.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumb***. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever mother****ing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a mother****ing Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It ****ing works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this ****. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, mother****er. It makes sense. It has mother****ing hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your *****-*** browser know what the ****'s in this ****ing site. That's semantics, mother****er.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the ****ing screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this mother****er in IE6. I ****ing dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no ****ing idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are ****ty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a ****ing message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's ****ing beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is ****ing satire, you ****</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your ****ty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-*****.</p>

    <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own mother****ing websites.</p>
